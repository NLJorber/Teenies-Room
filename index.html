        <p>Welcome to Teenie's Room. Your name is Righthand. You are part of the Hand Family that dwells under Teenie's bed. Usually, your job is to grab sneaky Underbed monsters and turn them to dust so Teenie can sleep safely at night. Teenie has gone to preschool, but she'll be back later. You've been waiting at the edge of the Underbed for Babyhand, who has gone exploring (against your wishes) and not yet returned. You realise you're going to have to search for her and bring her back to the Underbed. Sentryhand will keep watch while you search.</p>
